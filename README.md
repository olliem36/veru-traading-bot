# "Veru" BTC USDT Trading Bot

A "just for fun" trading bot made over the weekend when staying with family.

## Description

Binance BTC USDT trading bot made in [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript.

The bot looks to buy small dips in price and can accurately (89.9%) buy before a price increase.

Although the bot can predict a price rise with high accuracy when making a trade (Which is what I got hyped about!) the exchange fees murdered it and I can't backtest the bot to make a profit.

Add the following keys to .env.local to have a play
